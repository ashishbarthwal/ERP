# ERP operational analytics

Sign in and open `/analytics` for a live, read-only cockpit. The 7/30/90-day
selector uses UTC calendar days, including today. Invoiced value counts invoices
by creation date; collected value counts payments by posting date; received
purchase cost counts received purchase orders by receipt date. These events
can occur on different days and should not be subtracted to infer profit.

The invoicing/collections chart switches between Columns, Lines, Area, Pie,
and Donut. Pie and Donut show the selected measure's share across interval
groups; use their Invoiced/Collected control to change the measure. Select a
mark or legend item for its exact interval and values. Longer periods combine
adjacent buckets into at most five share groups. Charts remain read-only and
do not change the underlying transactions.

Open receivables, ordered purchase commitments and low-stock alerts are
**current snapshots**, unaffected by the period selector. Receivables are
unpaid invoice amounts after partial payments. The overdue figure is the
portion on invoices created more than 30 days ago; it is not a contractual
due-date calculation. Ordered commitments exclude draft purchase orders.
Stock alerts mean fewer than 10 available-minus-reserved units. Product rankings
use invoiced line prices, not the current product price. This is operational
reporting, not a general ledger or financial statement.

## Power BI Desktop starter

1. Use **Export daily CSV** on `/analytics`, while signed in. The export contains
   `date_utc,invoiced_cents,collected_cents,received_cost_cents` and one row for
   every UTC date in the selected period, including zero-activity dates.
2. In Power BI Desktop, **Get data > Text/CSV** and load the downloaded file.
   Set `date_utc` to Date and the amount columns to Whole number. Create
   measures such as `Invoiced = DIVIDE(SUM(ERP[invoiced_cents]), 100)` after
   naming the imported table `ERP`; format as the app's demo currency.
3. Plot `date_utc` against invoiced and collected measures. Re-export and refresh
   to see new transactions. The file is a manual snapshot, not a live Power BI
   connection. Keep the export private because it contains business totals.

The separate test repository has a different [automation-run Power BI model](https://github.com/ashishbarthwal/ai-self-healing-test-automation-framework/blob/main/analytics/powerbi/README.md)
for test reliability and change coverage. Do not mix its run/test rows with the
ERP's business transactions without a deliberate semantic model.
